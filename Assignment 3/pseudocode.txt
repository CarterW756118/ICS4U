Term Class:

constructor:
    store coeff inside the term
    store expo inside the term

is valid:
    return true if coeff is a number and expo is a whole number that is zero or greater
    otherwise return false

calculate:
    return coeff multiplied by x raised to expo

to string:
    if coeff is zero return an empty string
    if expo is zero return coeff as a string
    if expo is one return coeff followed by "x"
    otherwise return coeff followed by "x" raised to expo

Polynomial Class:

constructor:
    convert the given string into a list of term objects
    set the order of the polynomial based on how many terms it contains

is_valid:
    for each term in the polynomial:
        check if the term is valid
        if any term is not valid return false
    if all terms are valid return true

string to list:
    split the polynomial string into separate coefficient values
    make an empty list to hold term objects

    for each coefficient in order:
        try to convert it as an integer
        otherwise try to convert it as a decimal number
        if both fail, mark the coefficient as invalid

        determine the exponent based on its position in the list
        make a new term with the coefficient and exponent
        add it to the list

    return the completed list of terms

calculate y:
    set result to zero
    for each term in the polynomial:
        add the term’s calculated value at x to result
    return result

calculate area:
    choose a very large number of rectangles
    compute the width of each rectangle based on x1 and x2
    set area to zero

    for each rectangle:
        determine the x position at that rectangle
        calculate the height of the polynomial at that x position
        add the rectangle’s area (height times width) to the total

    return the total area

to string:
    start with an empty result string
    for each term in the polynomial:
        convert the term to a string
        if the result is not empty, add a separator like " + "
        then add the current term’s string
    return the final string

Driver:

get numeric interval:
    try to split the interval into a starting and ending value
    try to convert both values into numbers
    if successful, return both numbers
    if not, return two invalid values

initialize the polynomial, interval values, and a valid input boolean

while the input is not valid:
    ask the user for a polynomial string
    ask the user for an interval string

    create a polynomial using the user’s input
    convert the interval string to two numbers

    if the polynomial is valid and the interval was good:
        mark the input as valid
    otherwise:
        tell the user their input was invalid and to try again


display the polynomial as a string
compute the area under the polynomial over the given interval
display the resulting area
